## About
### Introduction
Scratch Number String Extension was developed between 2018 and 2019 by David Feng to extend the capabilities of Scratch with the Javascript Extension API.

This extension improves upon the default string and arithmetic operation blocks, as well as adding new features like browser control integrations and file IO.

### String Extensions
*string* (lower case of [**str**])

&emsp;returns the lower case of `str`

*string* (upper case of [**str**])

&emsp;returns the upper case of `str`

*number* (unicode of [**char**])

&emsp;returns the unicode encoding of character `char`
> parameter `char` must be of length 1, returns `-1` otherwise

*string* (character for unicode (**num**))

&emsp;returns the unicode character corresponding to `num`
> parameter `num` must be a positive integer, returns `""` (empty string) otherwise

*string* (replace all [**findStr**] in [**str**] with [**replaceStr**])

&emsp;finds all occurances of `findStr` in `str` and replace them with `replaceStr`

*bool* <string [**str**] contains [**substr**]>

&emsp;returns whether if `str` contains substring `substr` or not

*number* (number of [**substr**] in [**str**])

&emsp;returns the number of times `substr` occured in `str`

*number* (index of occurance (**num**) of [**substr**] in [**str**])

&emsp;finds the index (position) of the `num`th time `sbustr` occured in `str`
> This block uses Scratch-style indexing (i.e. counts from 1)
<br/> if `substr` is not found in `str`, returns `0`;
<br/> if parameter `num` is more than the number of times `substr` occured (over-indexing), `-1` is returned

*string* (letter (**startIndex**) to (**stopIndex**) of [**str**])

&emsp;slice `str` starting from the `startIndex`th character to the `stopIndex`
